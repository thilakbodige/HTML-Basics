        <h1 style="font-family:Segoe UI;">Facebook</h1><br><br>
        <p>Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the American technology conglomerate Meta.
            Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities.
            Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is 14 years.
            As of December 2023, Facebook claimed almost 3.07 billion monthly active users worldwide.[7] As of November 2024, Facebook ranked as the third-most-visited website in the world, with 23% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[9]
            Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing personal information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their friend or, with different privacy settings, publicly.
            Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, edit messages (within 15 minutes after sending),[10][11] join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.
            Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the site.[20] It became available successively to most universities in the US and Canada.[21][22] In 2004, Napster co-founder Sean Parker became company president[23] and the company moved to Palo Alto, California.[24] PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel gave Facebook its first investment.[25][26] In 2005, the company dropped "the" from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com.[27]
            In 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[28][29][30] Facebook introduced key features like the News Feed, which became central to user engagement. By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[31] Facebook had surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the world's most popular social media platform. Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($364 million in 2024 dollars[32]), giving Facebook an implied value of around $15 billion ($22.7 billion in 2024 dollars[32]). Facebook focused on generating revenue through targeted advertising based on user data, a model that drove its rapid financial growth. In 2012, Facebook went public with one of the largest IPOs in tech history. Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebook's dominance. In 2012, it purchased Instagram, followed by WhatsApp and Oculus VR in 2014, extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and virtual reality.
            The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 revealed misuse of user data to influence elections, sparking global outcry and leading to regulatory fines and hearings. Facebook's role in global events, including its use in organizing movements like the Arab Spring and its impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, highlighted its dual nature as a tool for empowerment and harm. In 2021, Facebook rebranded as Meta, reflecting its shift toward building the "metaverse" and focusing on virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.

        <h1 style="font-family:Twitter Chirp;">Twitter</h1><br><br>
        <p>Twitter, officially known as X since 2023, is an American microblogging and social networking service. It is one of the world's largest social media platforms and one of the most-visited websites.[6][7] Users can share short text messages, images, and videos in short posts commonly known as "tweets" (officially "posts") and like other users' content.[8]
            The platform also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, a chatbot (Grok), job search,[9] and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature.
            Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, and was launched in July of that year. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million daily tweets.[10] Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world.[11] A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023.[12] 10% of users produce over 80% of tweets.[13][14] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans.[15]
            The service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation[16][17][18] and hate speech.[19][20][21] Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology officer.[22][23][24] In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to "X" and the bird logo would be retired,[25][26] a process which was completed by May 2024. Since Musk's takeover, data from app-tracking firms has shown that global usage of Twitter has declined by approximately 15%, compared to a decline of 5â€“10% in some other social media sites.[27][28][29] The platform has disputed that usage has dropped at all, with Musk claiming without evidence that membership had grown to 600 million users as of a May 2024 tweet.[30]
            In March 2025, X Corp. was acquired by xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company. The deal, an all-stock transaction, valued X at $33 billion, with a full valuation of $45 billion when factoring in $12 billion in debt. Meanwhile, xAI itself was valued at $80 billion.
            Jack Dorsey claims to have introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate to a small group in 2006.[33] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[34] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[35] Work on the project started in February 2006.[36]
            The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees.[36] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[37] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo from the investors and shareholders.[38] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[39] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[40] The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[41]
            The company experienced rapid initial growth thereafter. In 2009, Twitter won the "Breakout of the Year" Webby Award.[42][43] In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.[44] By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications.[45] In June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter.[46] As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.[47]

            From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out "New Twitter", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites, including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface.[48] In 2019, Twitter was announced to be the 10th most downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[48]
            On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday by announcing that it had 140 million users, a 40% rise from September 2011, who were sending 340 million tweets per day.[49][50] On June 5, 2012, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter.[51][52] On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users.[citation needed] In September 2013, the company's data showed that 200 million users sent over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% of tweets sent from mobile devices.[53]
            2014, Twitter underwent a redesign that made the site resemble Facebook somewhat, with a profile picture and biography in a column left to the timeline, and a full-width header image with parallax scrolling effect.[c][54] Late in 2015, it became apparent that growth had slowed, according to Fortune,[55] Business Insider,[56] Marketing Land[57] and other news websites including Quartz (in 2016).[58] In 2019, Twitter released another redesign of its user interface.[59] By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[60] Twitter then experienced considerable growth during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.[61] The platform also was increasingly used for misinformation related to the pandemic.[62] Twitter started marking tweets which contained misleading information, and adding links to fact-checks.[63]
            Twitter began the research phase of Bluesky, an open source decentralized social media protocol where users can choose which algorithmic curation they want.[64][65] The same year, Twitter also released Twitter Spaces, a social audio feature;[66][67] "super follows", a way to subscribe to creators for exclusive content;[68] and a beta of "ticketed Spaces", which makes access to certain audio rooms paid.[69] Twitter unveiled a redesign in August 2021, with adjusted colors and a new Chirp font, which improves the left-alignment of most Western languages.

                <h1 style="font-family:Source Sans Pro">LinkedIn</h1><br><br>
                <p>LinkedIn is an American business and employment-oriented social network. It was launched on May 5, 2003 by Reid Hoffman and Eric Ly.[4] Since December 2016, LinkedIn has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.[5]
                    The platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and allows jobseekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015, most of the company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals and has also introduced their own ad portal named LinkedIn Ads to let companies advertise in their platform.[6]
                    LinkedIn has more than 1 billion registered members from over 200 countries and territories.[7]LinkedIn allows members (both employees and employers) to create profiles and connect with each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection.
                    LinkedIn can also be used to organize offline events, join groups, write articles, publish job postings, post photos and videos, and more.LinkedIn is an American business and employment-oriented social network. It was launched on May 5, 2003 by Reid Hoffman and Eric Ly. Since December 2016, LinkedIn has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.
                    LinkedIn filed for an initial public offering in January 2011. The company traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the NYSE symbol "LNKD", at $45 (~$60.00 in 2023) per share.[30] Shares of LinkedIn rose as much as 171% on their first day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange and closed at $94.25, more than 109% above IPO price. Shortly after the IPO, the site's underlying infrastructure was revised to allow accelerated revision-release cycles.[11] In 2011, LinkedIn earned $154.6 million in advertising revenue alone, surpassing Twitter, which earned $139.5 million.[31] LinkedIn's fourth-quarter 2011, earnings soared because of the company's increase in success in the social media world.[32] By this point, LinkedIn had about 2,100 full-time employees compared to the 500 that it had in 2010.[33]
                    In April 2014, LinkedIn announced that it had leased 222 Second Street, a 26-story building under construction in San Francisco's SoMa district, to accommodate up to 2,500 of its employees,[34] with the lease covering 10 years.[35] The goal was to join all San Francisco-based staff (1,250 as of January 2016) in one building, bringing sales and marketing employees together with the research and development team.[35] In March 2016 they started to move in.[35] In February 2016 following an earnings report, LinkedIn's shares dropped 43.6% within a single day, down to $108.38 per share. LinkedIn lost $10 billion of its market capitalization that day.[36][37]
                    In 2016, access to LinkedIn was blocked by Russian authorities for non-compliance with the 2015 national legislation that requires social media networks to store citizens' personal data on servers located in Russia.[38]
                    In June 2016, Microsoft announced that it would acquire LinkedIn for $196 a share, a total value of $26.2 billion. It was the largest acquisition made by Microsoft, until the acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022. The acquisition would be an all-cash, debt-financed transaction. Microsoft would allow LinkedIn to "retain its distinct brand, culture and independence", with Weiner to remain as CEO, who would then report to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Analysts believed Microsoft saw the opportunity to integrate LinkedIn with its Office product suite to help better integrate the professional network system with its products. The deal was completed on December 8, 2016.[39]
                    In late 2016, LinkedIn announced a planned increase of 200 new positions in its Dublin office, which would bring the total employee count to 1,200.[40] Since 2017 94% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn to distribute content.[41]
                    Soon after LinkedIn's acquisition by Microsoft, LinkedIn's new desktop version was introduced.[42] The new version was meant to make the user experience similar across mobile and desktop. Some changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app. Features that were not heavily used were removed. For example, the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported anymore.[43]
                    Following the launch of the new user interface (UI), some users complained about the missing features which were there in the older version, slowness, and bugs in it. The issues were faced by free and premium users and with both the desktop and mobile versions of the site.
                    In 2019, LinkedIn launched globally the feature Open for Business that enables freelancers to be discovered on the platform.[44][45] LinkedIn Events was launched in the same year.[46][47]
                    In June 2020, Jeff Weiner stepped down as CEO and become executive chairman after 11 years in the role.
